/**
 * 0: Variables are named containers for storing data and are scoped. One might think of a variable 
 * like a tentacle that points to a piece of data. This means that a variable that is globally scoped 
 * can be invoked or 'reached' at any subsequent point in the program.
 * 
 * 1. Declaration and Assignment: In order to create a variable we must first `declare` it. 
 * Depending on the declarative keyword you use, you may initialize the variable with a value or not. 
 * For instance, "var" 
 * 
 * 2. Var, let, const: There are three declarative keywords that can be used to declare variables--var, let, const. 
 * 
 * // => "var":
 * // => "let":
 * // => "const":
 * 
 * 3: Hoisting: During the Javascript reader's compilation phase, the program scans the data and pulls up certain variables, 
 * prioritizing named functions and varaibles declared with "var" first. Ultimately, the prioritized data that is pulled to the 
 * top of the code script, or "hoisted", is read first during the reading phase.
