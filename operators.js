/**
 ************************=> Operators <=***************************
 * 
 * 0: We use these to perform different types of mathematical and logical computations.
 * 
 * 1. Assignment Operators: "assigns" values.
 * 
 * 2. Arithmetic Operators: perform "arithemtic" to return a single value. These include traditional mathematical operators
 * such as +, -, *, / (add, subtract, multiply, divide, respectively). 
 * 
 * ==> Remainder: % (typically used to check if number is odd or even: "i % 2 === 0" would test for an even value). The remainder
 * operator is used to divide a number to see if there is a remainder, or if the number divides evenly. 
 * 
 * ==> Increment: ++ (typically used as incremental indicator in looping: "i++")
 * 
 * ==> Decrement: -- (typically used as decremental indicator in looping: "i--")
 * 
 * ==> Exponentiation: ** ()
 * 
 * 3. Comparison Operators: "compares" values. These include the traditional "greater than", "less than", "greater or equal to", 
 * and the "less or equal to" operators. 
 * 
 * ==> == (loosely equal to)
 * 
 * ==> === (strictly equal to)
 * 
 * ==> != (not equal)
 * 
 * ==> !== (not equal value && not equal data type)
 * 
 * 4. Logical Operators: used in boolean contexts to test for true/false. 
 *
 * ==> && (and)
 * 
 * ==> || (or)
 * 
 * ==> ! (Logical Not)
 * 
 * 
 * 5. Unary Operators (!, typeOf, -):
 * 
 * 6. Ternary Operators (a ? b: c):
