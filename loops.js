 *********************************=> Loops <=************************************
 * 
 * 0: aptly-named, loops iteratate through complex data such as arrays and objects. We use specific types of 
 * loops depending on the data type, the times we want to loop through the item, and other factors such as 
 * knowing the length property or the amount of keys in an object. 
 * 
 * When we iterate through an array or object, it's helpful to think in terms of each loop iteration 
 * "isolating" a singular element at a time to perform whatever action is specified in the loop's code block.
 * 
 * The loop's syntax includes a keyword, followed by parenthesis, which is then followed by a code block.
 * 
 * 1. => while loops: best for instances where we want the loop to iterate and run its code block at least once,
 * these loops are used when we don't know exactly how many times we want to iterate. It's important to 
 * specify a incremental/decremental condition, or an inifinite loop will occur, crashing the program.
 * 
 * => for loops: conversely to the while loop, a for loop is used when we know how many times we want to iterate
 * through a piece of data. We can set a stopping point in our conditions to indicate the number of iterations the 
 * loop performs. A third condition is set to specify the incremental/decremental direction. 
 * 
 * => for-in loops: used to iterate through objects, the for-in loop's syntax triggers iteration through each key 
 * in a given object. As each key is isolated, we can retrieve its value, or manipulate individual elements within
 * the object
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 2. Be able to loop any number of times, forward counting up to some limit, backward counting down to 0.
 * 
 * 3. Loop over an Array, forwards and backwards.
 * 
 * 4. Loop over an Object.
