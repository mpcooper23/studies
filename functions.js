/**
 * Functions
 * 
 * 0: Functions are pieces of reusable code (e.g. "set of instructions") that can be invoked at any point in a program. 
 * Like simple data declared through variables, a function exists as a piece of data stored in memory. Functions differ 
 * in that they can be invoked with arguments, or '"called" with data placed between the syntax's parentheses. The 
 * function's parameters act as placeholders, or slots waiting to be filled with the argument values.
