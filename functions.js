/**
 * Functions
 * 
 * 0: Functions are pieces of reusable code that can be invoked at any point in a program. Like simple data 
 * declared through variables, a function exists as a piece of data stored in memory. Functions differ in that
 * they can be invoked with arguments. The functions parameters act as placeholders, or slots waiting to be filled with
 * values that are called in the argument.
